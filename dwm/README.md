# My particular build of The Dynamic Window Manager.

This build of DWM is partially based on [Luke Smith's Build](https://github.com/LukeSmithXYZ/dwm).
Mostly because it had 50% of what I wanted out of dwm.
The keybindings are somewhat like i3 because I like the keyboard layout of i3 however
there are some modifications.
